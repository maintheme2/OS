Each entry is 16 bits, so the total size of the page table is 16 times the number of entries. 
The number of entries is the number of virtual addresses divided by the number of bytes per page. 
The number of virtual addresses is 2^16, and the number of bytes per page is 8 KB, 
so the number of entries is 2^16/8 KB = 2^16/2^13 = 2^3 = 8.
The total size of the page table is 32 bits per entry times 8 entries, or 256 bits.
